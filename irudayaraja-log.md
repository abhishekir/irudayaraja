assignment/project title: Assignment 1
time estimate: 15 hours

date/time: 1/19/20
place: WVH Lab
goal: Read assignment and make a list of requirements to complete, create repo
notes: This meeting was crucial for git repo configuration and planning. Especially making high level design decisions based on the assignment specs
duration: 2 hours
NEXT : (date/time/place of next meeting)  1/20/20   10:00AM   WVH

date/time: 1/20/20
place: WVH Lab
goal: Create the overall class diagram for the data adapter and create skeleton implementations these classes and their functions
notes: We accomplished our goal for this meeting because we were able to outline our entire program and have a clear idea of how much code needs to be written. We realized that due to the requirement to store a list of list of objects with different data types, we would need a single class that could encapsulate all these types. This meeting was overall productive and successful.
duration: 3 hours
NEXT : (date/time/place of next meeting)  1/21/20   10:00AM   WVH

date/time: 1/21/20
place: WVH 4th floor
goal: Write logic for CLI input and function to determine the schema of one SOR row
notes: In this meeting we realized the challenge involved with inferring the data type of a value within the '<...>' in the SOR. In most languages this is a typeof() function on a string that can determine class. However in CwC we needed to implement conditional branching on for each char in the string to determine type. Sid and I worked through this by writing psuedo-code for various implementation algorithims. We were able to constructively criticize each other and reach a well-designed solution.
duration: 4 hours
NEXT : (date/time/place of next meeting)    1/22/20 4:00PM   WVH

date/time: 1/22/20
place: WVH Lab
goal: Now that we can determine the schema, Create the Dataframe object and populate the dataframe with all elements of the SOR
notes: Our goal for this meeting ended up being overly ambitious because we didn't account for time needed to debug unexpected issues. Specifically, since we were now dealing with populating our DataFrame object which is a lot of allocated memory access, our bugs resulted in segmentation faults which took longer to debug than expected (because of no error line numbers). Additionally, since we had both been working on programming assignments for other classes earlier throughout the day we were too mentally tired to be optimally effective. This was important because we recognize the importance setting reasonable expectations and planning to account for bad/less productive days.
duration: 6 hours
NEXT : (date/time/place of next meeting)    1/23/20   5:00PM    WVH Lab

date/time: 1/23/20   5:00PM
place: WVH Lab
goal: Complete project and submit
notes: Knowing we didn't have time to meet on friday, we needed to complete the remainder of the assignment. We created the functions to query the DataFrame and connected these to the CLI inputs. Additionally we realized we needed to change our file processing logic to handle the -from and -len flags. Finally, we needed to complete documentation, testing, and part2 of the assignment. This was, again, too much work for one day which is a learning opportunity to better plan future assignments. In the end, we were able to submit a day early. Working with sid was a great experience because our strengths are complementary and we work well together.
duration: 8 hours
NEXT : (date/time/place of next meeting)  1/26/20   2:00PM    WVH Lab
